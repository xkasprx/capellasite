									My great great grand-pappy started this business long time ago. He helped the locals get
									what needed fixin', fixed. And fixed PDQ. Since I'm a third generation mechanic, I
									learnt everything I could need to know about cars from my dad. Since the recession, we had to get creative with how we work, but that is what makes our custom jobs a hit with our
									customers with state inspections that are guaranteed to pass.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
									I supervise two apprentices in troubleshooting, diagnosing, and repairing a wide variety
									of vehicle makes and models. I also manage day-to-day schedule and operations of the
									repair shop, maintaining strong focus on quality workmanship and customer service.

									Every year we host the chili cook-off free of charge to help feed the locals, we get the
									flea market goin and everyone has a blast. Donations are accepted at the shop. During
									our free time we like to hunt and fish. Everyone is invited to come and join! This
									picture is of me and my wife, pregnant with our 9th kid, she works double shifts at the
									Tumbleweed Diner, and makes the best apple pie!
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
									I am a highly skilled and dependable mechanic with hands-on experience conducting
									service, diagnostics, and repairs on domestic and imported automobiles and trucks.
									I demonstrated expertise in interpreting technical specifications. I try to stay caught
									up with current technologies, but we don't get too many newer cars round here.
